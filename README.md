# docker-ingumanizer
We are testing and fooling around with docker. Nothing more and nothing less. 

There will be 4 folders in total.

## Getting Started
This project is all about docker, so i recommend downloading and installing Docker Desktop from the official webpage before anything else.

### Dependencies
- Caffeine


### Installing

### Executing Program


## Known Issues

### Delopgave 2
As per this assignment, simply having docker compose and build the .yaml by itself will solve it, but the CMD needs to have ["python", "app.py"] for it to run. The clamps are important.

### Delopgave 3
I know on a conceptual level on what to, how it works and where it should be done, but i cannot get it to work in any way that matters.

Have docker make me the webserver and the db and then connect them, then add a volume for persistence. I cannot figure out the commands.
